### Canadian bankruptcy rates: time series analysis

The goal of this project is to forecast monthly bankruptcy rates in Canada for the year 2011, with the highest possible accuracy. To do so, several time series modeling techniques were employed, and the results can be seen in the final report pdf file.

Initial data was made available from January 1987 until December 2010, which is a wide enough range for building our prediction model. We will call this the training data, as our model will be "trained" using these observations.
